WFJS: Withered Foxy Jumpscare.

This is a fully client-side mod. This mod activates for each player individually under these conditions:
- Landed on a moon
- The moon is not Gordion (The Company moon)
- The player is alive
- The ship is not in the landing or leaving sequence

While active, there is a 1/10000 (0.01%) chance every second for the Withered Foxy jumpscare from Five Night at Freddy's 2 to play. For reference, this comes out to appoximately 30%, 51%, 66%, or 76% after 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours, respectively. 

This mod's name being an acronym (Lethal Company WFJS) and its short description ("Adds WFJS.") being cryptic is intentional. This mod is inteded to be inserted into modpacks for friend groups discreetly by the host as a joke. Also to this end, there is a secret toggle: Pressing the backslash ('\\') key on the main menu will toggle it on or off. In the game's log, this will be cryptically referred to as "functionality enabled" or "functionality disabled". By default it is enabled, of course.
